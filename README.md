The ExpandableLayout class extends FrameLayout and provides functionality for creating expandable and collapsible layouts. It allows users to toggle visibility of content within the layout with smooth animations. This class is particularly useful for creating expandable sections in user interfaces.

Key Components:

    Attributes:
        Context mContext: Stores the context of the layout.
        AttributeSet mAttrs: Stores the attributes of the layout.
        NestedScrollView nestedScrollView: A nested scroll view to contain the expandable content.
        LinearLayout verticalLayout: A vertical linear layout to organize child views vertically.
        LinearLayout horizontalLayout: A horizontal linear layout for the title and arrow view.
        TextView titleView: Displays the title of the expandable layout.
        FrameLayout contentFrameLayout: Contains the expandable content.
        ImageView arrowView: Displays an arrow icon to indicate expand/collapse state.
        int uniqueId: Unique identifier for the layout.
        boolean expanded: Flag to indicate if the layout is expanded or collapsed.
        boolean animating: Flag to indicate if an animation is currently in progress.
        long animDuration: Duration of the expansion/collapse animation.
        String titleText: Text for the title of the layout.
        Drawable arrowImage: Drawable for the arrow icon.

    Methods:
        ExpandableLayout(Context context, AttributeSet attrs): Constructor to initialize the layout and attributes.
        init(Context context, AttributeSet attrs): Initializes the layout components and attributes.
        expandContent(): Expands the content of the layout with animation.
        collapseContent(): Collapses the content of the layout with animation.
        getContentHeight(): Measures the height of the expandable content.
        setTitle(String title): Sets the title of the layout.
        setImage(Drawable drawable): Sets the arrow icon drawable.
        setImage(int imageResId): Sets the arrow icon drawable from a resource ID.
        isExpanded(): Returns whether the layout is expanded.
        setExpanded(boolean isExpanded): Sets the expanded state of the layout.
        getUniqueId(): Returns the unique identifier of the layout.

    Nested ExpandableLayouts Handling:
        The ExpandableLayout class supports nesting of multiple instances, allowing for parent-child relationships.
        Nested ExpandableLayout instances can be added as content within another ExpandableLayout, facilitating complex layout structures.

Functionality:

    The ExpandableLayout class allows users to create expandable sections within their app's UI.
    It handles the expansion and collapse animations smoothly.
    Users can customize the title, arrow icon, and initial expansion state of the layout.
    Supports nesting of multiple ExpandableLayout instances for creating hierarchical layouts.

Usage:

    Instantiate an ExpandableLayout object in your Java code.
    Set the title and arrow icon drawable if needed using setTitle() and setImage() methods.
    Add content views to the layout using addView() or by including them in the XML layout file.
    Toggle the expand/collapse state programmatically using setExpanded() method or by user interaction.

Example:

java

ExpandableLayout expandableLayout = new ExpandableLayout(context, null);
expandableLayout.setTitle("Sample Title");
expandableLayout.setImage(R.drawable.arrow_icon);
expandableLayout.setExpanded(true);
// Add content views to expandableLayout
parentLayout.addView(expandableLayout);

Benefits:

    Provides a clean and intuitive way to organize and present expandable content in the app's UI.
    Enhances user experience by allowing users to focus on relevant content while keeping non-essential content hidden.
    Supports nesting of multiple ExpandableLayout instances for creating hierarchical layouts.

Considerations:

    Ensure proper handling of content layout to avoid unexpected behavior during expansion and collapse.
    Test the layout on various screen sizes and orientations to ensure consistent behavior.

Conclusion:
The ExpandableLayout class simplifies the implementation of expandable sections in Android apps, offering smooth animations, customization options, and support for nested layouts for a better user experience.
